# NexusForgottenTrackedMods
A tool for finding tracked mods from Nexus Mods that you never downloaded

It's still in development stage, it can only be used with personal API keys for now and for local development purposes only.
Since it's not quite finished yet, you'll have to create a file called "APIKey.py" in the root folder and inside of it add "key = 'YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY'" replacing YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY with your Nexus API Key

# NEVER UPLOAD YOUR API KEY!!
# NEVER SHARE YOUR API KEY!!
